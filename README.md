# R-OS
Welcome to R-OS! (Use your imagination for the meaning of the R)

The roadmap for the future:
- [ ] Get/set graphical setup from multiboot
- [ ] User interface
- [ ] Develop USB driver
- [ ] USB mouse driver (mouse is ps/2 only so far)

Code source:
Currently, I am using the help of GRUB as a bootloader.
And the multiboot.h is not my code.
Most of the code is ~~stolen~~ adapted from my own older osdev projects.
